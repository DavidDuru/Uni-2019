Week 4 notes

doing them here because fuckheads keep voting for the liberal party

Some extra rules for building tables

Not all tables ualify as a relation
    - every relation must have a unique name
    - coluimns inb table must haver unique names
        --the ordewr of the columns doesnt matter

All tuples in a relation have the same structure, constructed form the same set of attributes

Every attribute value is atomic (can't be composed of multiple values, be a class, list, set)

Every row is unique, (can't have two rows with the identical name and values)

SQL: describe what data we are interested in but not how to retrieve it

commands can be, DDL data defintion language, DML data manipulation language

We can specifcy integrity constraints, NULL/NOT NULL for some for columns, so the input cant be null for example

primary key: unique minial identiferi ogf a relation    
        example include, employee numbers, social security numbers etc, we use this to ensure rows are unique

foriegn key: a (set) of attribute(s) in one relation tha refers to a tuple in another relation, like a logical pointer

In a database of students for example
???

Join: combine data from different tables that fit together
